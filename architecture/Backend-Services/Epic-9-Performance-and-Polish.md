- Create cache invalidation strategies for data consistency
- Implement cache warming for critical application paths
- Add performance monitoring and cache hit ratio tracking
- Support cache partitioning for multi-tenant scenarios

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Distributed caching reduces database load by 70%+
- [ ] Query caching improves restaurant search response time significantly
- [ ] HTTP caching reduces server load for static content
- [ ] Cache invalidation maintains data consistency
- [ ] Cache warming prevents cold start performance issues
- [ ] Monitoring provides visibility into cache performance
- [ ] Multi-tenant cache partitioning prevents data leakage
- [ ] All tests are green

### 35. Implement Production Error Handling and Monitoring with TDD

**User Story**: As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error handling and monitoring so that I can maintain system reliability and quickly resolve issues when they occur.

**Technical Requirements**:
- Implement global exception handling with structured logging
- Add application performance monitoring (APM) integration
- Create custom health check endpoints for all system components
- Implement distributed tracing for request flow visibility
- Add alert systems for critical error conditions
- Create error recovery mechanisms and circuit breakers
- Implement user-friendly error messages with error tracking
- Add automated error reporting and escalation procedures

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Global exception handling captures and logs all errors appropriately
- [ ] APM integration provides comprehensive application insights
- [ ] Health checks enable proactive system monitoring
- [ ] Distributed tracing helps diagnose complex issues
- [ ] Alert systems notify administrators of critical conditions
- [ ] Circuit breakers prevent cascade failures
- [ ] User error messages are helpful while protecting system details
- [ ] All tests are green

### 36. Implement API Security Hardening and Rate Limiting with TDD

**User Story**: As a security administrator, I want robust API security measures so that the system is protected against common attacks and abuse while maintaining good performance for legitimate users.

**Technical Requirements**:
- Implement comprehensive API rate limiting with multiple strategies
- Add API key management system for external integrations
- Create request validation and sanitization middleware
- Implement SQL injection and XSS protection mechanisms
- Add CORS configuration for secure cross-origin requests
- Create API versioning strategy for backward compatibility
- Implement request/response logging for security auditing
- Add automated security scanning integration

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents API abuse while allowing legitimate usage
- [ ] API key system enables secure third-party integrations
- [ ] Input validation prevents injection attacks
- [ ] XSS protection secures user-generated content
- [ ] CORS configuration balances security with functionality
- [ ] API versioning supports system evolution
- [ ] Security logging enables threat detection and compliance
- [ ] All tests are green
