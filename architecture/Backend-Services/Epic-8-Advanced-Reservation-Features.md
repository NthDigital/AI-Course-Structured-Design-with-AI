- `DELETE /api/waitlist/{waitlistId}` - Remove from waitlist
- Implement intelligent waitlist matching based on preferences

### 33. Implement Recurring Reservation System with TDD

**User Story**: As a regular customer, I want to set up recurring reservations so that I can maintain my regular dining schedule without repeatedly booking the same time slot.

**Technical Requirements**:
- Create recurring reservation API endpoints and management
- `POST /api/reservations/recurring` - Create recurring reservation pattern
