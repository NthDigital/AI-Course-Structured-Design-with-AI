# Definition of Done

This Definition of Done reflects enterprise-grade development standards appropriate for a production-ready restaurant booking system. Each checkbox represents a critical quality gate that must be satisfied before considering any feature "complete."

## Code Quality & Architecture
- [ ] Code implemented following Clean Architecture principles with proper layer separation
- [ ] Domain entities encapsulate business logic and validation rules
- [ ] Repository interfaces defined in Core layer, implementations in Infrastructure layer
- [ ] Dependency injection properly configured with appropriate service lifetimes
- [ ] No circular dependencies between layers
- [ ] SOLID principles applied throughout the codebase

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- [ ] **Unit tests written first** following Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- [ ] **Comprehensive test coverage**: Minimum 90% code coverage for business logic
- [ ] **Test categories**: Unit tests, integration tests, performance tests, security tests
- [ ] **Entity tests**: 100% coverage for domain entities and value objects
- [ ] **Service tests**: All business logic tested in isolation with mocked dependencies
- [ ] **API tests**: End-to-end integration tests for all endpoints
- [ ] **Edge case tests**: Boundary conditions, null values, invalid input scenarios
- [ ] All tests are green and pass consistently

## API Design & Documentation
- [ ] RESTful API endpoints follow consistent naming conventions
- [ ] Comprehensive input validation with detailed error messages
- [ ] Proper HTTP status codes for all response scenarios
- [ ] Request/Response DTOs with complete validation attributes
- [ ] **OpenAPI/Swagger documentation** generated and up-to-date
- [ ] API versioning strategy implemented
- [ ] Rate limiting and throttling configured
- [ ] CORS policies properly configured

## Security Implementation
- [ ] **Authentication**: JWT tokens with proper claims and expiration
- [ ] **Authorization**: Role-based and resource-based policies implemented
- [ ] **Password security**: BCrypt hashing with salt
- [ ] **Account security**: Lockout mechanisms after failed attempts
- [ ] **Token security**: Refresh token rotation and concurrent usage detection
- [ ] **Security headers**: HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.
- [ ] **Input sanitization**: Protection against injection attacks
- [ ] **Security logging**: Authentication events and security violations tracked

## Performance & Scalability
- [ ] **Multi-layer caching**: In-memory, Redis, and database query caching
- [ ] **Cache invalidation**: Dependency-based invalidation strategies
- [ ] **Database optimization**: Proper indexing and query optimization
- [ ] **API response times**: Sub-200ms for cached data, sub-500ms for dynamic data
- [ ] **Connection pooling**: Database connections properly managed
- [ ] **Background processing**: Non-critical operations handled asynchronously
- [ ] **Load testing**: System handles 1000+ concurrent users

## Error Handling & Monitoring
- [ ] **Global exception handling**: Structured error responses with correlation IDs
- [ ] **Comprehensive logging**: Structured logging with appropriate log levels
- [ ] **Health checks**: All dependencies monitored (database, cache, external services)
- [ ] **Performance monitoring**: Response times, memory usage, database metrics
- [ ] **Error analytics**: Error rates, trends, and alerting configured
- [ ] **Graceful degradation**: System remains functional during partial failures

## Database & Data Management
- [ ] **Entity Framework migrations**: All schema changes properly versioned
- [ ] **Database seeding**: Sample data for development and testing environments
- [ ] **Data validation**: Entity-level validation enforced at database level
- [ ] **Audit trails**: Change tracking for critical business entities
- [ ] **Transaction management**: Proper unit of work patterns implemented
- [ ] **Database constraints**: Foreign keys, unique constraints, and check constraints

## Business Logic & Domain Rules
- [ ] **Domain-driven design**: Business rules encapsulated in domain entities
- [ ] **Business validation**: Comprehensive validation services with configurable rules
- [ ] **Workflow management**: State transitions properly controlled and validated
- [ ] **Business analytics**: Reporting and dashboard functionality implemented
- [ ] **Data integrity**: Referential integrity maintained across all operations

## Code Review & Quality Gates
- [ ] **Peer review**: Code reviewed by at least one senior developer
- [ ] **Architecture review**: Changes reviewed for architectural compliance
- [ ] **Security review**: Security implications assessed and approved
- [ ] **Performance review**: Performance impact analyzed and acceptable
- [ ] **Code quality tools**: Static analysis tools pass without critical issues
- [ ] **Documentation review**: Technical documentation updated and accurate

## Deployment & Operations
- [ ] **Environment configuration**: Settings externalized and environment-specific
- [ ] **Infrastructure as Code**: Database migrations automated
- [ ] **Deployment pipeline**: Automated build, test, and deployment process
- [ ] **Rollback strategy**: Ability to revert changes if issues are discovered
- [ ] **Monitoring setup**: Application monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] **Backup strategy**: Data backup and recovery procedures tested

## User Experience & Acceptance
- [ ] **Functional requirements**: All acceptance criteria met and verified
- [ ] **User stories**: Business value delivered as specified
- [ ] **Error handling**: User-friendly error messages and graceful error handling
- [ ] **Performance requirements**: System meets or exceeds performance targets
