# Introduction 

These are the prompts used to generate the backend service files, using the intial specification files as a starting point. Each prompt corresponds to a specific epic or feature in the restaurant booking system.

```
Please improve the backend-specification document, taking the requirements in the introduction and the known database table design, please rewrite the document, and produce a task list that we can trun into github issues to build the required backend functionality incrementally

It should also have a comprehensive detail about the API endpoints for the front end to use in the future
```

```
Ok thats great, I have taken the development task brakdown and moved it to a new document,

Lets review this task breakdown, with reference to what we allready have in the project files (we already have the basic walking skeletion that we have tested togather so we have a react app with backend api)

there is no code in the walking skeletion yet for our project, 

Lets rewrite the development task breakdown document so that each task can be used as a github issue and a prompt into copilot to build the app eventually, make each step as detailed and compreshenive as possible remember we will be building this using TDD so tests will be written as part of the process 

Dont actually write any code yet, lets just get the planning done in this development task breakdown
```

```
Ok lets try just rewriting the first epic

Epic 1: Project Setup and Infrastructure
have a look at the project structure as it stands and rewite the tasks within this epic as requested above
```
```
thats brillent thankyou
can we now do the same thing for epic 2

Epic 2: User Authentication System
```
```
yes please lets do epic 3
```
.....

```
can you review the whole document now please with an eye to the estimated timeline we have noted at the bottom of the document, is this still a valid timeline if not can you update it please with valid numbers
```

```
do we need to update the defination of done right at the bottom of the document?
```

```
can we move each epic into its own markdown file use the file title "Epic-{number}-{description}.md"

replace number with the epic number and replace description with the description, replacing spaces with "-"

the development-task-breakdown document will then become a summary of the tasks required and each epic document will be a detaild set of instructions for each epic,

this will make it easier for a human to read and help with orginising hte work for copilot
```

```
The Development Task Breakdown will be a summary document, we are having issues building it all in one go so lets start with each epic in turn,

I think each epick should be a link to the file containing the epic details along with a short description of the epic estimated time to complete and any other useful information you think,

do the summary for epic 1 first leave everything below the total estimated duration line alone as we will look at that later
```

```
How do we feel about the new development task breakdown file does it match our requirements for a summary can you improve it?
```
