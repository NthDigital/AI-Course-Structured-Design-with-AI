# Epic 4: Table Management System

## Overview
**Phase**: Restaurant Management (Sprint 5)  
**Duration**: 3 weeks  
**GitHub Issues**: 4 issues  
**Epic Goal**: Enable restaurant owners to manage tables, track table status in real-time, analyze table utilization, and configure optimal table layouts for maximum efficiency and customer satisfaction.

## GitHub Issues

### 18. Implement Table CRUD Operations with TDD

**User Story**: As a restaurant owner, I want to manage tables for my restaurants so that customers can make reservations for specific table configurations and capacities.

**Technical Requirements**:
- Create authenticated API endpoints for table management
- `POST /api/restaurants/{restaurantId}/tables` - Create table
- `GET /api/restaurants/{restaurantId}/tables` - List tables
- `GET /api/restaurants/{restaurantId}/tables/{tableId}` - Get table details
- `PUT /api/restaurants/{restaurantId}/tables/{tableId}` - Update table
- `DELETE /api/restaurants/{restaurantId}/tables/{tableId}` - Delete table
- Ensure only restaurant owners can manage their own restaurant tables
- Validate table number uniqueness within each restaurant
- Implement soft delete for tables with existing reservations
- Add table capacity validation and business rules
- Track table creation and modification history

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] All table CRUD endpoints implemented with proper authorization
- [ ] Table number uniqueness enforced within each restaurant
- [ ] Capacity validation prevents invalid table configurations
- [ ] Soft delete implemented for tables with reservations
- [ ] Authorization ensures owners can only manage their tables
- [ ] Table status management follows business rules
- [ ] Audit trail tracks all table modifications
- [ ] All tests are green

### 19. Implement Table Status Management with TDD

**User Story**: As a restaurant owner, I want to manage table status in real-time so that the reservation system accurately reflects table availability and restaurant operations.

**Technical Requirements**:
- Create API endpoint `PATCH /api/restaurants/{restaurantId}/tables/{tableId}/status`
- Implement real-time table status updates (Available, Occupied, Maintenance)
- Add bulk status update functionality for multiple tables
- Implement automatic status transitions based on reservations
- Add status change validation and business rules
- Track status change history for analytics and auditing
- Implement status-based availability calculations
- Add notifications for critical status changes

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Table status update endpoint with proper validation
- [ ] Status transition rules enforced correctly
- [ ] Automatic status updates based on reservations work
- [ ] Bulk status update functionality implemented
- [ ] Status change history tracked and auditable
- [ ] Restaurant status overview provides real-time data
- [ ] Critical status change notifications implemented
- [ ] All tests are green

### 20. Implement Table Availability Analytics and Reporting with TDD

**User Story**: As a restaurant owner, I want to view table utilization analytics and reports so that I can optimize my restaurant layout and capacity planning.

**Technical Requirements**:
- Create API endpoint `GET /api/restaurants/{restaurantId}/tables/analytics`
- Implement table utilization reporting with time-based analysis
- Add capacity optimization recommendations
- Generate peak hours and popular table analysis
- Implement historical trend analysis for table usage
- Add comparative analytics (day-over-day, week-over-week)
- Create table performance metrics and KPIs
- Implement exportable analytics data

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Table analytics endpoint returns accurate utilization data
- [ ] Utilization calculations verified against actual reservations
- [ ] Peak hours detection algorithm identifies busy periods
- [ ] Capacity recommendations provide actionable insights
- [ ] Historical trend analysis shows meaningful patterns
- [ ] Table performance metrics help identify issues
- [ ] Analytics support different time periods and granularity
- [ ] All tests are green

### 21. Implement Table Layout and Configuration Management with TDD

**User Story**: As a restaurant owner, I want to define table layouts and configurations so that the reservation system can optimize table assignments and provide better customer experiences.

**Technical Requirements**:
- Create API endpoints for table layout management
- `GET /api/restaurants/{restaurantId}/tables/layout` - Get layout
- `PUT /api/restaurants/{restaurantId}/tables/layout` - Update layout
- Implement table grouping and combination features
- Add table preference and special attribute management
- Implement table assignment priority rules
- Add visual layout representation (coordinates/positions)
- Support different seating arrangements and configurations

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Table layout endpoints allow configuration management
- [ ] Visual layout representation supports positioning
- [ ] Table grouping and combination features work correctly
- [ ] Assignment priority rules influence table selection
- [ ] Table attributes support diverse restaurant configurations
- [ ] Layout validation prevents invalid configurations
- [ ] Zone management supports different dining areas
- [ ] All tests are green

## Success Criteria

### Operational Excellence
- Restaurant owners can efficiently manage all aspects of their table inventory
- Real-time status tracking provides accurate availability information
- Analytics drive data-informed decisions about table management
- Layout optimization maximizes capacity utilization and customer satisfaction

### Technical Performance
- Table operations support high-frequency status updates

- Real-time updates don't impact system performance
- Layout management supports complex restaurant configurations

### Business Intelligence
- Utilization analytics identify optimization opportunities
- Performance metrics guide capacity planning decisions
- Trend analysis supports strategic business planning
- Recommendation engine provides actionable insights

### User Experience
- Intuitive table management interface for restaurant owners
- Real-time status visibility improves operational efficiency
- Analytics dashboards provide clear, actionable insights
- Layout management supports visual restaurant design

This epic provides the comprehensive table management foundation that enables optimal space utilization and supports the sophisticated reservation algorithms in subsequent epics.
