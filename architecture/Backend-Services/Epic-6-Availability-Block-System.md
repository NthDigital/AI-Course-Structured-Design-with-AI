# Epic 6: Availability Block System

## Overview
**Phase**: Advanced Scheduling (Sprint 6)  
**Duration**: 2 weeks  
**GitHub Issues**: 3 issues  
**Epic Goal**: Enable restaurant owners to block specific time periods and tables from reservation booking, providing granular control over availability for maintenance, private events, and operational requirements.

## GitHub Issues

### 25. Implement Availability Block Creation and Management with TDD

**User Story**: As a restaurant owner, I want to block specific times and tables from reservation booking so that I can schedule maintenance, private events, and other operational activities without customer interference.

**Technical Requirements**:
- Create authenticated API endpoints for availability block management
- `POST /api/restaurants/{restaurantId}/availability-blocks` - Create block
- `GET /api/restaurants/{restaurantId}/availability-blocks` - List blocks
- `GET /api/restaurants/{restaurantId}/availability-blocks/{blockId}` - Get details
- `PUT /api/restaurants/{restaurantId}/availability-blocks/{blockId}` - Update block
- `DELETE /api/restaurants/{restaurantId}/availability-blocks/{blockId}` - Delete block
- Support different block types: table-specific, time-based, full restaurant
- Implement block priority and conflict resolution
- Add block categories (maintenance, private event, staff meeting)
- Include reason tracking and internal notes

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Availability block CRUD endpoints with proper authorization
- [ ] Block types support various operational scenarios
- [ ] Table-specific blocks don't affect other table availability
- [ ] Time-based blocks properly integrate with reservation system
- [ ] Block conflicts are detected and resolved appropriately
- [ ] Category system enables block type organization
- [ ] Reason tracking provides operational transparency
- [ ] All tests are green

### 26. Implement Availability Block Validation Service with TDD

**User Story**: As a system administrator, I want availability blocks to be validated against existing reservations and business rules so that blocks don't create operational conflicts or customer service issues.

**Technical Requirements**:
- Create validation service for availability block conflicts
- Check against existing reservations before block creation
- Implement block overlap detection and resolution
- Add business rule validation for block constraints
- Handle cascade effects of blocking on related reservations
- Implement conflict resolution suggestions and alternatives
- Add validation for minimum advance notice requirements
- Create rollback mechanisms for invalid block operations

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Block validation prevents conflicts with existing reservations
- [ ] Overlap detection identifies scheduling conflicts accurately
- [ ] Business rules ensure blocks follow operational guidelines
- [ ] Cascade effect handling protects existing customer reservations
- [ ] Conflict resolution provides actionable alternatives
- [ ] Advance notice validation prevents last-minute operational issues
- [ ] Rollback functionality maintains system integrity
- [ ] All tests are green

### 27. Implement Recurring Availability Block Patterns with TDD

**User Story**: As a restaurant owner, I want to create recurring availability blocks so that I can efficiently manage regular maintenance schedules, staff meetings, and other recurring operational activities.

**Technical Requirements**:
- Create API endpoints for recurring block management
- `POST /api/restaurants/{restaurantId}/recurring-blocks` - Create pattern
- `GET /api/restaurants/{restaurantId}/recurring-blocks` - List patterns
- `PUT /api/restaurants/{restaurantId}/recurring-blocks/{patternId}` - Update
- `DELETE /api/restaurants/{restaurantId}/recurring-blocks/{patternId}` - Delete
- Support various recurrence patterns (daily, weekly, monthly, custom)
- Implement pattern exception handling for special dates
- Add bulk generation of blocks from recurring patterns
- Include pattern modification with future instance control

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Recurring block CRUD operations with pattern support
- [ ] Recurrence patterns handle standard scheduling requirements
- [ ] Exception handling allows pattern customization
- [ ] Bulk generation creates appropriate individual blocks
- [ ] Future instance control manages pattern modifications
- [ ] Pattern deletion provides options for existing instances
- [ ] Custom patterns support unique operational requirements
- [ ] All tests are green

## Success Criteria

### Operational Control
- Restaurant owners have complete control over table and time availability
- Maintenance scheduling doesn't conflict with customer reservations
- Private events can be accommodated without system complications
- Staff activities are protected from customer booking interference

### System Intelligence
- Validation prevents operational conflicts before they occur
- Conflict resolution provides practical alternatives
- Recurring patterns reduce administrative overhead
- Integration with reservation system maintains availability accuracy

### Flexibility and Efficiency
- Block management adapts to diverse operational requirements
- Recurring patterns handle routine operational activities
- Exception handling accommodates special circumstances
- Bulk operations support efficient schedule management

### Customer Experience Protection
- Existing reservations are protected from operational changes
- Available booking times accurately reflect actual availability
- Conflict prevention eliminates customer disappointment
- Transparent availability helps customers find suitable alternatives

This epic provides the sophisticated availability control that enables restaurants to balance customer service with operational requirements, setting the foundation for advanced reservation management features.
