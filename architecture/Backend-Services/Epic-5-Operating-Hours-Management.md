## Overview
**Phase**: Restaurant Configuration (Sprint 4)  
**Duration**: 2 weeks  
**GitHub Issues**: 3 issues  
**Epic Goal**: Enable restaurant owners to configure flexible operating hours, handle special scheduling situations, and provide accurate availability information to the reservation system and customers.

## GitHub Issues

### 22. Implement Operating Hours Configuration with TDD

**User Story**: As a restaurant owner, I want to configure my restaurant's operating hours so that customers can only make reservations during open hours and the system accurately reflects my availability.

**Technical Requirements**:
- Create authenticated API endpoints for operating hours management
- `GET /api/restaurants/{restaurantId}/operating-hours` - Get operating hours
- `PUT /api/restaurants/{restaurantId}/operating-hours` - Update operating hours
- Support different hours for each day of the week
- Handle restaurants with multiple service periods per day
- Implement time zone handling for multi-location restaurants
- Add default hour templates for common restaurant types
- Support seasonal hour adjustments and temporary changes

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Operating hours endpoints with proper restaurant owner authorization
- [ ] Weekly schedule configuration supports different hours per day
- [ ] Multiple service periods per day (lunch, dinner) supported
- [ ] Time zone handling ensures accurate availability calculations
- [ ] Hour validation prevents invalid configurations
- [ ] Template system speeds up initial restaurant setup
- [ ] Temporary hour changes don't affect permanent schedule
- [ ] All tests are green

### 23. Implement Operating Hours Validation Service with TDD

**User Story**: As a customer, I want the system to prevent me from making reservations outside operating hours so that I don't waste time on invalid bookings.

**Technical Requirements**:
- Create operating hours validation service for reservation requests
- Implement business rule validation for different service periods
- Add buffer time configuration (prep time, closing procedures)
- Handle edge cases: midnight crossover, 24-hour restaurants
- Implement holiday and special day handling
- Add advance booking limitations based on operating schedule
- Create validation error messages with suggested alternatives
- Support real-time availability checking

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Validation service accurately enforces operating hour restrictions
- [ ] Buffer times properly applied to opening and closing times
- [ ] Midnight crossover scenarios handled correctly
- [ ] Holiday hours override regular schedule appropriately
- [ ] Advance booking limits respected based on operating schedule
- [ ] Clear error messages guide customers to valid times
- [ ] Real-time validation prevents invalid reservation attempts
- [ ] All tests are green

### 24. Implement Special Days and Holiday Management with TDD

**User Story**: As a restaurant owner, I want to configure special operating hours for holidays and events so that my availability accurately reflects my actual operating schedule during special periods.

**Technical Requirements**:
- Create API endpoints for special day management
- `GET /api/restaurants/{restaurantId}/special-days` - List special days
- `POST /api/restaurants/{restaurantId}/special-days` - Create special day
- `PUT /api/restaurants/{restaurantId}/special-days/{specialDayId}` - Update
- `DELETE /api/restaurants/{restaurantId}/special-days/{specialDayId}` - Remove
- Support closed days, modified hours, and special events
- Implement recurring special day patterns (annual holidays)
- Add special day priority handling when conflicts occur
- Create bulk import for common holiday calendars

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Special day CRUD operations with proper authorization
- [ ] Special days override regular operating hours correctly
- [ ] Recurring patterns reduce repetitive configuration work
- [ ] Priority system resolves conflicting special day rules
- [ ] Bulk import supports standard holiday calendars
- [ ] Special event hours accommodate unique situations
- [ ] Date range special days support multi-day events
- [ ] All tests are green

## Success Criteria

- Edge cases (midnight crossover, timezone changes) are handled correctly
- Performance remains optimal even with complex scheduling rules
- Data integrity is maintained for all schedule modifications

### Customer Experience
- Customers only see valid reservation times based on actual operating hours
- Clear messaging explains availability restrictions
- Alternative time suggestions help customers find suitable slots
- Real-time validation provides immediate feedback

### Business Intelligence
- Operating hour analytics identify optimization opportunities
- Special day tracking supports capacity planning
- Usage patterns inform schedule adjustment decisions
- Integration with other systems maintains schedule consistency

This epic establishes the scheduling foundation that enables accurate availability calculations and supports sophisticated reservation management in the core booking functionality.
